# paint-label

> Effects (FX) for Direct3D 9 (fx_2_0) reader

---

**paint-label** is a partial port of the Effects reading of [mojoshader](https://github.com/icculus/mojoshader), ported to full C#. It also uses some references from [Ved-s/ShaderDecompiler](https://github.com/Ved-s/ShaderDecompiler), which adapts mojoshader's parsing as well.
